<h1 align="center">Radix</h1>

A fast, native macOS disk space analyzer that makes crowded drives easy to understand. Scan folders and volumes, explore where your storage is going, compare results over time, and safely clean up — all without leaving the app. Visit the [Radix website](https://tryradix.app) to learn more!

## Why Radix?

Storage fills up quietly. Radix makes it obvious where it went — no Terminal commands, no waiting through scans that crawl forever. Point it at a folder, sit back, and explore a clean visual breakdown of directories and files.

It's built with Swift and SwiftUI, designed to feel like a natural part of macOS.

## Highlights

### Visualize Disk Usage

Switch between **sunburst** and **treemap** views to understand how space is distributed. Hover over an item to inspect it, then double-click a folder to drill deeper.

### Browse and Search

Use the sortable file table to inspect sizes, search the current folder or the entire scan, and move through the hierarchy with breadcrumbs and back/forward navigation.

### Compare Scans Over Time

Compare two scans to see which files and folders grew, shrank, appeared, or disappeared.

### Review Cleanup Candidates

Add items from the disk map, file browser, or inspector to the **Discard Pile**. Review everything together before deciding whether to move anything to the Trash.

### Save and Reopen Results

Export completed scans as compact, losslessly compressed exact snapshots and
reopen them later as read-only results. Radix continues to open snapshots
created by earlier supported versions.

## More Features

- Fast, iterative file-system scanning with live progress
- Faster follow-up scans by reusing previous results when possible
- Automatic summarization of directories containing thousands of tiny files
- Custom scan exclusions for paths you do not want to include
- Optional free-space display in disk maps
- Smart Locations for mounted volumes, Home, Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Library, and Applications
- Recent scan history in the sidebar
- Conservative cleanup suggestions for reproducible build artifacts, dependencies, and caches
- Detailed inspector with sizes, access information, parent directory, and largest children
- Usage stats showing scans completed, data scanned, scan speeds, chart interactions, and cleanup totals — all stored locally on your Mac
- Quick Look, Open, Reveal in Finder, Copy Path, and Move to Trash actions
- Drag and drop a folder into the window to start scanning
- Automatic updates powered by [Sparkle](https://sparkle-project.org/)

### Privacy & Permissions

Radix works out of the box on any folder you can already access. For some folders, the app may require **Full Disk Access**. Radix detects when files are skipped due to permissions and guides you through enabling them in System Settings.

## Installation

Radix requires **macOS Sonoma 14 or later**.

### Homebrew

```bash
brew install --cask radix
```

<summary>View a quick note from me, the developer behind Radix</summary>

When people began asking me to get Radix on Homebrew, I never imagined we'd get there so quickly. We only had half of the required stars, and I thought it might take a while before the project was ready.

But here we are now. Radix is on Homebrew, and it's because of your incredible support. Thank you for all the stars, comments, and feedback. Moreover, thank you for giving Radix a chance. I am so, so grateful for the positive feedback you all have given me.

I'm excited to continue improving Radix. Please keep the feedback coming, and thank you again!

### Manual Installation

Download the latest version from [Releases](https://github.com/colinvkim/Radix/releases/latest) or the [Radix website](https://tryradix.app), then drag Radix into your Applications folder.

## Building from Source

Building Radix requires **Xcode 26 or later** with a Swift 6.2 toolchain.

Clone the repository and run the Swift package tests:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/colinvkim/Radix.git
cd Radix
swift test
```

Open `Radix.xcodeproj` in Xcode to build and run the complete app, or build it from the command line:

```bash
xcodebuild \
  -project Radix.xcodeproj \
  -scheme Radix \
  -configuration Debug \
  -destination 'platform=macOS' \
  build
```

The SwiftPM package contains `RadixCore` and its tests. Use `swift test` to run the test suite, and use the Xcode project to build the complete app.

## Architecture

- `ScanEngine` is an actor-based asynchronous scanner that uses iterative file-system traversal.
- `AppModel` is the central `@MainActor` state and coordination layer for the application.
- `ScanSnapshot` and `FileTreeStore` represent scan results using flat tree storage and indexed lookups.
- Archive and comparison services stream, validate, and compare `.radixscan`
  snapshots. Format v5 losslessly compresses the large node and topology
  sections with LZFSE while retaining v3/v4 import compatibility.
- Sunburst and treemap services separate layout and interaction models from their SwiftUI presentation.
- `RadixCore` has no external Swift package dependencies; the app target uses Sparkle for updates.
